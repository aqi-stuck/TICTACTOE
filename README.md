# 🧮 C++ Project — Predictive or Analytical Program

## 📘 Overview
This project is written in **C++** and demonstrates structured programming principles including input/output handling, basic computation, and algorithmic design.  
The program is self-contained and runs entirely on the console.

---

## ⚙️ Features
- Written in clean, modular C++ code
- Demonstrates basic algorithmic logic
- Easy to compile and run on any platform with a C++ compiler
- Beginner-friendly and fully commented

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- Functions and modular design
- Conditional statements and loops
- Data types and I/O streams
- Possibly file handling or mathematical computation (depending on code)

## 🚀 How to Compile and Run

### On Linux / macOS
```bash
g++ p.cpp -o program
./program
```

### On Windows (MinGW or similar)
```bash
g++ p.cpp -o program.exe
program.exe
```

---

## 🧩 Example Output
```bash
> ./program
Enter value: 5
Result: 25
```

*(Output will vary depending on program logic.)*
